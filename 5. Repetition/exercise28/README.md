# Adding Numbers

In previous programs, you asked the user for repeated input by  
writing the input statements multiple times.  
But is't more efficient to use loops to deal with repeated input.

Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and computes the total of the numbers.

**Example Output**  
*Enter a number: 1*  
*Enter a number: 2*  
*Enter a number: 3*  
*Enter a number: 4*  
*Enter a number: 5*  
*The total is 15.*

**Constraints**
- The prompting must use reptition, such as a counted loop, not three separate prompts.
