# Website Generator

Programming lanuages can create files and folder too.

Create a program that generates a website skeleton with the following specification:

- Prompt for the name of the site.
- Prompt for the author of the site.
- Ask if the user wants a folder for JavaScript files.
- Ask if the user wants a folder for CSS files.
- Generate an index.html file that contains the name of the site inside the `<title>` tag and the author in a `<meta>` tag.

**Example Output**

*Do you want a folder for CSS? y*  
*Created ./awesomeco*
