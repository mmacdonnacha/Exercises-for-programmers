# Parsing a Data File
Sometimes data comes in as a structured format that you have to break down and turn into records so you can process them. CSV or coma-separated values is a common standard for doing this.

Construct a program that reads in the following data file:

Ling, Mai, 55900  
Johnson, Jim, 56500  
Jones, Aaron, 46000  
Jones, Chris, 34500  
Swift, Geoffrey, 14200  
Xion, Fong, 65000  
Zarnecki, Sabrina, 51500

Process the records and display the results formatted as a table, evenly spaced as shown in the example output.

**Example Output**
<pre>
Last     First    Salary
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Ling     Mai      55900
Johnson  Jim      56500
Jones    Aaron    46000
Jones    Chris    34500
Swift    Geoffrey 14200
Xion     Fong     65000
Zarnecki Sabrina  51500
</pre>

**Constraints**
- Write your own code to parse the data.  
  Don't use a CSV parser.
- Use spaces to align the columns.
- Make each column one space longer than the longest value in the column.
