# Word Frequency Finder

Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block  
of text is helpful for creating word clouds and other types  
of word analysis. And it's more useful when running it  
against lots of text.

Create a program that reads in a file and counts the frequency  
of words in the file. Then construct a histogram displaying  
the words and the frequency and display the histogram to  
the screen.

**Example Output**  
*Given the text file words.txt with this content*  

*badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom*  
*snake badger badger badger*

*the program would produce the following output:*
```
badger:    *******  
mushroom:  ** 
snake:     *
```

**Constraints**  
- Ensure that the most used word is at the top of the report  
  and the least used words are at the bottom.
