# Product Search

Pulling data from a file into a complex data structure makes  
parsing much simpler. Many programming languages support  
the JSON format, a popular way of representing data.

Create a program that takes a product name as input and  
retrieves the current price and quantity for that product. The  
product data is in a data file in the JSON format and looks  
like this: 

```JSON
{
  "products" : [
    {"name": "Widget", "price" : 25.00, "quantity": 5},
    {"name": "Thing",  "price" : 15.00, "quantity": 5},
    {"name": "Doodad", "price" : 5.00,  "quantity": 10}
  ]
}
```

Print out the product name, price and quantity if the product  
is found. If no product matches the search, state that no  
product was found and start over.

**Example Output**  
*What is the product name? iPad*  
*Sorry, that product was not found in our inventory.*  
*What is the product name? Widget*  
*Name: Widget*  
*Price: $25.00*  
*Quantity on hand: 5*  

**Constraints**  
- The file is in JSON format. Use a JSON parse to pull  
  the values out of the file.
- If no record is found, prompt again.
