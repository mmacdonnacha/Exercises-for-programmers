# Filter Values

Sometimes input you collect will need to be filtered down.  
Data structurs and loops can make this process easier.

Create a program that prompts for a list of numbers separated by spaces.  
Have the program print out a new List containing only the even numbers.

**Example Output**  
*Enter a list of number separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8*  
*The even numbers are 2 4 6 8*

**Constraints**
- Convert the input to an array.  
  Many languages can easily convet strings to arrays with built-in function that splits apart a string based on a specified delimiter.
- Write you own algorithm
  Don't rely on the language's built-in filter or similar enumeration feature.
- Use a function called *filterEvenNumebrs* to encapsulate the logic for this.  
  The function takes in the old array and returns the new array.
