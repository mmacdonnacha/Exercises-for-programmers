# Password Generator

Coming up with a password that meets specific requirements is something your computer can do. And it will give you practice using random number generators in conjunction with a list of known values.

Create a program that generates a secure password.  
Prompt the user for the minimum length, thenumber of special characters and the number of numbers.  
Then generate a password for the user using those inputs.

**Example Output**  
*What's the minimum length? 8*  
*How many special charactes? 8*  
*How many numbers? 8*  
*Your password is*  
*aurn2$1s#*

**Constraints**
- Use lists to store the characters you'll use to generate the passwords.
- Add some randomness to the password generation
