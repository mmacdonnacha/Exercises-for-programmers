# Magic 8 Ball

Arrays are great for storing possible responses from a program.  
If you combine that with a random number generator,  
you can pick a random entry from this list, which works great for games.

Create a Magic 8 Ball game that prompts for a question and  
then displays either "Yes", "No", "Maybe" or "Ask again later.".

**Example Output**  
*What's your question? Will I be rich and famous?*  
*Ask again later.*

**Constraints**
- The valuie should be chosen randomly using a pseudo random number generator.  
  Store the possible choices in a list and select one at random.
