# Currency Conversion

At some point you might have to deal with currency
exchange rates, and you'll need to ensure your calculations 
are as precise as possible

Write a program that converts currency. Specifically convert 
euros to U.S. dollars. Prompt for the amount of money in 
euros you have and prompt for the current exchange rate 
of the euro. Print out the new amount in U.S. dollars. 
The formula for currency conversion is

amountTo = (amountFrom X rateFrom) / rateTo

where
-amountTo is the amount in U.S. dollars.
-amountFrom is the amount in euros.
-rateFrom is the currecnt exchange rate in euros.
-rateTo is the current exchange rate of the U.S. dollar.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
- How amny euros are you exchanging? 81
- What is the exchange rate? 137.51
- 81 euros at an exchange rate of 137.51 is 111.38 U.S. dollars.

CONSTRAINTS
-Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
