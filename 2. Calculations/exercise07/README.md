# Area of a Rectangle Room

When working in a global environment, you'll have to  
present information in both metric and Imperial units. And  
you'll need to know when to do the conversion to ensure  
the most accurate results.

Create a prgram that calculates the area of a room. Prompt  
the user for the length and width of the room in feet. Then  
display the area in both square feet and square meters.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT**  
*What is the length of the room in feet? 15*  
*What is the width of the room in feet? 20*  
*You entered dimensions of 15 feet by 20 feet.*  
*The area is*  
 *300 square feet*  
 *27.871 square meters*
