# Paint Calculator

Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather
than follow standard rounding rules.

Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a 
room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one
gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons
needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
-You will need to puchase 2 gallons of 
 paint to cover 360 square feet.

-Remember, you can't buy a partial gallon of paint. 
 You must round up to the next whole gallon.

CONSTRAINT
-Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.
-Ensure that you round up to the next whole number
