# Simple Math

You'll often write programs that deal with numbers.
And depending on the programming language you use, you'll
hav to convert the inputs you get to numerical data types.

Write a program that prompts for two numbers.
Print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers
as shown in the example output:

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
-What is the first number? 10
-What is the second number? 5
- 10 + 5 = 15
- 10 - 5 = 5
- 10 * 5 = 50
- 10 / 5 = 2

CONSTRAINTS
-Values coming from users will be strings.
 Ensuring that you convert these values to numbers before doing the math.
-Keep the inputs and output separate from the numerical conversions
 and other processing.
-Generate a single output statement with line breaks in the appropriate spots.
