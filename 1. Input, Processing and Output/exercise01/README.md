# Saying Hello

The "Hello, World" program is the first program you learn  
to write in many lanuages, but it doesn't involve any input.

So create a program that prompts for your name and prints  
a greeting using your name.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT**  
*What is your name? Brian*  
*Hello, Brian, nice to meet you !*


**CONSTRAINT**
- Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.
