# Legal Driving Age

You can test equality, but you may need to test to see  
how a number compares to aknown value and display a  
message if the number is too low or too high

Write a program that asks the user for their age and compare  
it to the legal driving age of eighteen. If the user is eighteen or  
older, then the program should display "You are old enough to legally drive."  
If the user is under eighteen, the program should  
display "You are not old enough to legally drive."


**Example Output**  
*What is your age? 15*  
*You are not old enough to legally drive.*

Or

*What is your age? 35*  
*You are old enough to legally drive*

**Constraints**
- Use a single output statement
- Use a ternary operator to write this program.  
  If your language doesn't support a ternary operator, use a  
  regular if/else statement, and still use a single output  
  statement to display the message.
