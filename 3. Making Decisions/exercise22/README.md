# Comparing Numbers

Comparing one input to a known value is common enough,  
but you'll often need to process a collection of inputs.

Write a program that asks for three numbers.  
Check first to see that all numbers are different.  
If they're not different then exit the program.  
Otherwise, display the largest number of the three.

**Example Output**  
*Enter the first number: 1*  
*Enter the second number: 51*  
*Enter the third number: 2*  
*The largest number is 51*

**Constraints**
- Write the algorithm manually.  
  Don't use a built-in function for fingin the largest number in a list.
