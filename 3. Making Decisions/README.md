# BMI Calculator

You'll often need to see if one value is within a certain range  
and alter the flow of a program as a result.

Create a program to calculate the body mass index (BMI)  
for a person using the person's height in inches and weight in pounds.  
The program should prompt the user for weight and height.

Calculate the BMI by using the following formula:  
*bmi = (Weight/(height * height)) * 703*

If the BMI is between 18.5 and 25, display that the person is at a normal weight.  
If they are out of that range, tell them if they are underweight or  
overweight and tell them to consult their doctor.

**Example Output**  
*Your BMI is 19.5.*  
*You are within the ideal weight range.*  

Or

*Your BMI is 32.5*  
*You are overweight. You should see your doctor.*

**Constraints**
- Ensure your program takes only numberic data.  
  Don't let the user continue unless the data is value
