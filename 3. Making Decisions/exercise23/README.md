# Troubleshooting Car Issues

An *expert system* is a type of artifical intelligence program that uses a  
knowledge base and a set of rules to perform a task that a human expert might do.  
Many websites are available that will help you self-diagnose  
a medical issue by answering a series of questions.  
And many hardware and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools  
to help people solve simple technical issues before calling a human.

Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car.
